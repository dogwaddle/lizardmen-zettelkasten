## Note to Visitors (8/20/21)

Howdy all, maintenance update. I've been mantaining the light version only of this theme, so I'm not sure how functional the dark version is below. I only fix issues with it as needed for me to work in my own vault because it is the theme that I use on a daily basis. So I apologize if there is something funky about it. I uploaded the latest version from my personal vault. 

I've also uploaded an alternative version that I recently adopted in the past two weeks that features muted links (linked notes are only underlined) because that makes readability easier for me personally. Hope you enjoy!
