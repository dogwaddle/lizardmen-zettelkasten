## Note to Visitors (01/07/2022)

Howdy! I've been using this theme for the past month. In doing so, I've been tweaking it to work slightly different and with the Andy Mode plugin instead of CSS code. 
* obsidian.css - the current active theme that I'm using and updating
* obsidianAlt.css - a theme from august of last year that has muted links for easier readability
* obsidianOriginal.css - the theme that was previously here, in case anyone prefers this

## Muted Version of the Theme

Difference with this one is that the links aren't blue and instead just underlined. In addition to that, hovered internal links are red now, while external hovered links are blue.
